## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
- [BEM](https://getbem.com/) - CSS naming methodology
- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) - Accessibility

### What I learned

- Screen reader accessibility - elaborate
- Normalize CSS - elaborate
- Prettier Ignore

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) - This guide is helping me to better understand how to make the content of my web sites accessible to as many users as possible, including those with disabilities such as "blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations."[^1]
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - While I've used Sass in the past, their documentation helped me get a better understanding of this CSS preprocessor tool.
- [BEM](https://getbem.com/) - This guide helped me adopt the methodology and naming convention for organizing CSS code to make it more readable, scalable, and easier to maintain.
- [Normalize CSS](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - This seems to be the most comprehennsive CSS reset (but not actually a reset) that I've found so far. I haven't compared it line-by-line with Eric Meyer's CSS Reset as of yet, but it is in my plans. I'm also reading in the about section that it doesn't reset every element, instead it "retains many useful default browser styles[^2]." I do notice, however, that this post is written in 2012, so I may have to dig deeper into some research. While browsing Normalize css's [GirHub](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css), I came across an interesting [issue](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/issues/880) that shows that the project may no longer be maintained. There are some alternatives by the community that I may look into. [This one](https://github.com/u1ui/norm.css) has tons of listed resources.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
